# LLM ZoomCamp 
This repository contains my learning journey and work from the [LLM ZoomCamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp).

# Project Overview
In this project, I will be applying the concepts and techniques learned from the course to build and fine-tune a language model. The goal is to explore the potential of large language models and experiment with different architectures, datasets, and fine-tuning strategies to solve a real-world problem for a specific audience. The potential project can be related to interview assistant.
